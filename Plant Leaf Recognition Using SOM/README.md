# Plant Leaf Recognition Using SOM
### Abstract
In this assignment we demonstrate the use of Self Organizing Map (SOM) as a technique for plant leaf recognition. Given a set of leaves from different plants, we train the SOM
using different images of the same leaf. Once the network is trained, it can be used to identify plants when a particular leaf picture/image is the input. Such algorithms can be useful
for travelers, botanists and other plant enthusiasts. A number of geometrical aspects and other features of each plant leaf are extracted using image processing techniques. Once these
features are available, they are used as training data for the SOM and further analysis. We use the publicly available Folio dataset containing leaf images belonging to 32 different plants.
We compare the accuracy obtained by SOM with a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
