#Automated Spike Sorting
### Abstract  
Neural spike sorting is a challenging unsupervised machine learning problem where neural spikes are to be clustered based on the similarity of their shapes. In this project, we have discussed various solutions to this problem and demonstrated the performance of our algorithms on the datasets provided. We look at different feature extraction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis, wavelets etc. and at different clustering algorithms. Of the algorithms considered, it was determined through the testing results that the combination of Haar wavelet features and Gaussian Mixture Models yielded the best clustering accuracy and we discuss in detail the results obtained. We also identify areas for further improvement of the algorithms considered.
