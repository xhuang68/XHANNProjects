# Time Series Forecasting
### Abstract
In this assignment, we use the multi-layer perceptron as well as an ensemble learning technique in order to perform time series forecasting. That is, given the present and few past values of a quantity e.g., stock price of a company, we predict its value in a future time instant. For training, we use the time series provided to us. For the multi-layer perceptron, we use the Levinburg-Marquardt algorithm to perform the backpropagation. For the ensemble learning model, we use bootstrap aggregating (bagging) by training multiple multilayer perceptrons with different initializations, different number of hidden neurons etc.
